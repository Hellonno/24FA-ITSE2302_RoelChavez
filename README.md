This project includes a variety of languages including but not limited to JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
The website is about what animal is better cats and dogs. My design and code is very human it uses css code to style and make the website more visually appealing than a bland website; the CSS code to add text and to add images and the javascript is just there.
